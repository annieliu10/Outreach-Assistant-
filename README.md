# Outreach Assistant


As a global talent member at AIESEC, my responsibilities include generating leads through contacting local
owners to partner with our club and holding sales meetings. As work piles up at times, I have to juggle between schoolwork
 and my club commitments. Given the mass number of reputable companies of various sizes in different industries, I also struggle with
determining which ones I should contact. Hence, I developed a tool that is able to 
speed up the outreach process and rid the humdrum routine of continuously checking 
whether they are suitable companies as well as inputting a mass amount of data into Salesforce. 

Da-da! This application is an **outreach tool** that is designed to guide people in 
**outreach positions** through each phase by maximizing efficiency and increasing their 
success in striking deals with other companies. The application consists of 
three components including **pre-contact**, **mid-contact** as well as **post-contact** respectively. 

## Pre-contact
Pre-contact handles filtering out the companies that have recently been contacted in
the past months and ones that are out of preference as well as inputting company information into the system.  

## Mid-contact 
Mid-contact manages prioritizing the list of companies that should be contacted in order based on their size and 
industry. In addition, it ensures that no sales meetings are booked on the same day. 

## Post-contact
Post-contact simply takes care of the follow-up based on companies' interest or satisfaction levels.
